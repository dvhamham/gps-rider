# GPS Rider

**GPS Rider** is a powerful Android app and Xposed module that allows you to change your device's location system-wide, without enabling Android's mock location setting. This is ideal for testing, automation, privacy, and bypassing apps that detect or block mock locations.

---

## üì± Features

- **System-wide fake location**: Change your device's location for all apps, without enabling mock location.
- **Start/Stop/Toggle fake location**: Control the fake location service easily.
- **Set custom location**: Enter latitude and longitude to set any location.
- **Randomize location**: Randomize your location within a specified radius for extra privacy.
- **Set accuracy**: Control the reported GPS accuracy.
- **Get current fake location**: Retrieve the current spoofed coordinates.
- **Favorites**: Save and quickly switch between favorite locations.
- **Material You UI**: Modern, beautiful, and responsive interface using Jetpack Compose.
- **Intent API**: Control the app programmatically from other apps via Intents.
- **No mock location detection**: Uses advanced Xposed hooks and anti-detection techniques to hide all traces of mock location.
- **Multi-process and system service hooks**: Works at the system level for maximum compatibility.
- **Root/Xposed required**: Works with LSPosed/EdXposed.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- **Xposed Hooks**: The app uses Xposed to hook into Android's `LocationManager` and `Location` classes, intercepting location requests from all apps and system services.
- **Bypass Mock Detection**: It forcibly sets `isFromMockProvider` to `false` and uses hidden APIs to prevent apps from detecting that the location is fake.
- **No Mock Location Permission Needed**: You do not need to enable "Allow mock locations" in developer settings.
- **System Service Level**: Hooks are applied at both app and system service levels for maximum reliability.
